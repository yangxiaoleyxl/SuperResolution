# Introduction

This project implements simpler and faster End-to-End, Lightweight SISR methods under 4Ã— up-scale, summarizes and compares performance of them. The traditional models include Nearest Neighbor, Biliear and Bicubic. The deep learning-based models include SRCNN, FSRCNN, MAFFSRN,  NEAREST, BSRN, DRRN, ESPCN, RFDN and IMDN

# Installation 

``` shell
conda create -n sr python=3.8 -y

conda activate sr

conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

``` 

Run the requirements.txt file to install all the dependencies.

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

# Training 
Taking the IMDN model as an example, the training command is as follows:

``` shell
python train.py --model IMDN
```  

# Test 
Taking the IMDN model as an example, the test command is as follows:

``` shell
python test.py --model IMDN
``` 
The PSNR and SSIM of the test results will be provided.  

# Results
The qulitative results of the test are shown below.
